If a JMP entry doesn't require an appear_flag, disappear_flag, EventFlag, etc. value, then it will use 0 as a value. Which means, if you enable this flag, almost all JMP entries will be disabled! It's best to leave this flag alone. @span                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                      |                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                  |                                                 |

Once a part of the process finishes, the flag is turned off to continue event02. For event52, the flag executes ASM that runs the process in one go and replaces edsentak with dkikai. Strangely, event37 checks for it. @span=6:0                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                      |                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                  |                                                 |
