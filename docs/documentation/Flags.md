### **Description**

Flags are boolean (`ON`/`OFF`) variables that help the game keep track of progress.<br>
There are 255 flags in the game, each with different saving properties that can be divided into one of three groups: Savable Flags, Room Flags, and Map Flags.

!!! info "Types of Flags"

	=== "Savable Flags<br>(1-84)"
		Once these flags are turned `ON`, they will stay `ON`. The state of these flags can be saved to the memory card.

		- [x] Can save ON/OFF status to memory card.
		- [x] If ON, flag stays ON after leaving current map.
		- [x] If ON, flag stays ON after leaving current room.

	=== "Room Flags<br>(85-169)"
		Once these flags are turned `ON`, they'll only be active for the current <u>room</u> Luigi is in. If Luigi exits the room, these flags will reset back to `OFF`.

		- [ ] Can save ON/OFF status to memory card.
		- [ ] If ON, flag stays ON after leaving current map.
		- [ ] If ON, flag stays ON after leaving current room.

	=== "Map Flags<br>(170-255)"
		Once these flags are turned `ON`, they'll only be active for the current <u>map</u> Luigi is in. If Luigi warps to a different map, these flags will reset back to `OFF`.

		- [ ] Can save ON/OFF status to memory card.
		- [ ] If ON, flag stays ON after leaving current map.
		- [x] If ON, flag stays ON after leaving current room.

The status of these flags can be checked with Events, JMP Tables, and ASM.<br>
The table below lists all 255 flags and what they are tied to.

| This flag, similar to the concept of event00, is used as a placeholder for jump tables. If a JMP entry doesn't require an appear_flag, disappear_flag, EventFlag, etc. value, then it will use 0 as a value. Which means, if you enable this flag, almost all JMP entries will be disabled! It's best to leave this flag alone. @span                                         |           |                                                                      |                                    |                   |                              |                    |

| Turned on at the end of event01. This disables the event from happening again, enables the Foyer Toad cutscene event17, enables the falling behavior for the Foyer Chandelier due to move type 20, and makes the event01 Parlor cutscene models disappear. This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once. @span |           |                                                                      |                                    |                   |                              |                    |

| Turned on with ASM once Luigi attempts to open the Parlor doors on a new save file and activates event07.
