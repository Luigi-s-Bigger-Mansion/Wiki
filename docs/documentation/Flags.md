A list of all 255 flags in the game and their usage in JMap tables *(jmp)*, events, and ASM. Only the first 84 flags are able to be saved to the memory card. Flags **85** and above are temporary flags that will reset back to OFF if Luigi exits the current room/leaves the map, the game is reset, or the power is turned off. **NOTE: All DOL offsets listed below are for the NTSC-U version of Luigi's Mansion.**

=== "Savable Flags"

    ##Savable Flags

    Once these flags are turned ON, they will stay that way unless turned off in an event. The state of these flags can be saved to the memory card, allowing the game to "remember" if certain things have happened before.

    !!! example "Savable Flags (Flag OFF)"

    	``` mermaid
    	graph LR
        Start --> A(Flag Is OFF)
    	  A --> B((Turn Flag ON)) --> C{{Leave Room}} & D{{Leave Map}} & E{{Save & Reset Game}} & F{{Don't Save & Reset Game}}
        C & D & E --> G(((Flag Is Still ON)))
        F --> H{Flag Is Now OFF}
    	```
    !!! example "Savable Flags (Flag ON)"

If a JMP entry doesn't require an appear_flag, disappear_flag, EventFlag, etc. value, then it will use 0 as a value. Which means, if you enable this flag, almost all JMP entries will be disabled! It's best to leave this flag alone.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

This disables the event from happening again, enables the Foyer Toad cutscene event17, enables the falling behavior for the Foyer Chandelier due to move type 20, and makes the event01 Parlor cutscene models disappear. This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once.                                                                                                                                                     |

This flag disables event85 and the bmtelesa model in the Attic hallway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This flag will make sure the ASM that plays the ghost laughter sound effect and turns on the flag won't execute again. This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once.                                                                                                                                                                               |

This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

This flag is automatically turned on if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

It makes event10 load instead of event09 in the Training Room. This flag is automatically turned on if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Gadd gives his initial lecture to Luigi, preventing that part of event08 from happening again. Once this flag is on, ASM will execute that switches the cutscene when loading into the main game mode from the prologue cutscene to the E. Gadd waving cutscene. Nintendo put <FLAGON>(7) into a few other events, but the one that matters is in event08. This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once.                       |

In the PAL version it's turned off in the beginning of event08, and then turned on when going to the Hidden Mansion. It seems that Nintendo was originally using this flag to prevent the Lab from flipping in Hidden Mansion mode, but they settled on an ASM Event tag fix instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Gadd. This flag prevents this explanation from occurring again and also removes the Angel Statue requirement from event28 in the Gallery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If Luigi completes the sequence, then this flag will be turned on early at the end of event94. This flag also gives the Courtyard and Foyer Toads: event04 and event17 respectively, new dialogue about the Blackout.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Once Luigi picks the phone up in event93, this flag is turned off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This flag activates event15 so that E. Gadd can warn Luigi about Portrait Ghosts before finding Neville.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This flag makes sure that event36 and event37 never happen again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This flag will make the Toad's dialogue faster upon revisiting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It can also be turned on in event77 after scanning the statues with the GBH. The player will not be allowed to progress in event28 until this flag is on. This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once.                                                                                                                                                        |

It is not actually possible to suck up okeito1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This flag swaps furnitureinfo, enemyinfo, and objinfo entries, removes the chest on the ceiling, and acts as a reminder for the game to swap the Guest Room archive from room_28.arc to room28A.arc and flip the mirror in the room after resetting the game so that the room is properly flipped upon revisit.                                                                                                              |

An observer detects when this flag is turned on and activates the SPACE soundobj. This flag also acts as a reminder for the game to remove the collision for the Observatory wall and add the boundaries around the wooden plank upon reset, so that the room is halfway cleared upon revisit. The Shining Ghost generator star will also become active once this flag is ON due to ASM.                                                |

When this flag is on, then the event knows to play the cutscene where Bogmire spawns out of the tombstone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This flag removes the extra dialogue Madame Clairvoya will say when she examines the first item that you ever bring her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This flag will make the Toad's dialogue faster upon revisiting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The Boo hatch, using move type 31, detects that this flag has been turned on and will open. This flag also activates event69, leading to the Boo release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The telesa generator, once activated, allows Boos to spawn in rooms. This flag is also used in event08 so that E. Gadd knows when to lecture Luigi about releasing the Boos.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This flag allows the gravestone effect in event65 to play correctly. This flag also deactivates the skuls in the Graveyard, although this is unnecessary since Luigi is unable to leave the room and reset it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

This flag executes ASM that enables the LED bulb textures for the Boo Radar and displays the Boo count on the save screen when saving a file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Since nothing is tied to it, this flag is useless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

This flag disables event73 and the King Boo model in the hallway so that Luigi can enter the Secret Altar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This flag will execute ASM that turns the plant from the Seed to Blossom stage in Area 3. If Luigi forgets to water the plant in Area 3, then the plant will turn from Blossom to Kareki in Area 4, killing it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

If watered in the Blossom stage, this flag will execute ASM that turns the plant from the Blossom to Nut stage in Area 4. If watered in the Seed stage, the plant will turn from Seed to Blossom like usual, but in Area 4, the plant will turn from Blossom to Kareki, killing it.                                                                                                                                                                      |

This flag activates both event31 and event51 at the same time, preventing event31 from running twice. This flag also enables Chauncey in the Nursery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

=== "Room Flags"

    ## Room Flags

    Once these flags are turned ON, they'll only be active for the current room Luigi is in. If Luigi exits the room, all of these flags will reset back to OFF unless certain ASM is forcing them to stay ON.

=== "Map Flags"

    ## Map flags

    Once these flags are turned ON, they'll only stay that way while Luigi is still in the current map. If Luigi is warped to another map, or the player decides to turn off/soft-reset the game, all of these flags will reset to OFF unless certain ASM is forcing them to stay ON.

When Luigi's HP reaches 0, this flag executes ASM that resets the current map by warping Luigi, exactly like <WARP> , to the luige entry's coordinates with appear_point = 0. This flag will not heal Luigi, instead leaving him at 1 HP. Essentially, this flag prevents a Game Over from occurring as long as it's on. |
