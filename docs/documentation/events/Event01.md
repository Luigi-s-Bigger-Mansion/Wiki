If a JMP entry doesn't require an appear_flag, disappear_flag, EventFlag, etc. value, then it will use 0 as a value. Which means, if you enable this flag, almost all JMP entries will be disabled! It's best to leave this flag alone.                                                                                                                                                                       |

This disables the event from happening again, enables the Foyer Toad cutscene event17, enables the falling behavior for the Foyer Chandelier due to move type 20, and makes the event01 Parlor cutscene models disappear. This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once.                                                                                                                               |

This flag disables event85 and the bmtelesa model in the Attic hallway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

This flag will make sure the ASM that plays the ghost laughter sound effect and turns on the flag won't execute again. This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once.                                                                                                                                                         |

This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This flag is automatically turned on if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It makes event10 load instead of event09 in the Training Room. This flag is automatically turned on if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Gadd gives his initial lecture to Luigi, preventing that part of event08 from happening again. Once this flag is on, ASM will execute that switches the cutscene when loading into the main game mode from the prologue cutscene to the E. Gadd waving cutscene. Nintendo put <FLAGON>(7) into a few other events, but the one that matters is in event08. This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once. |
| 8      | N/A       | N/A                                                                  | event08 (PAL)                      | N/A               | N/A                          | N/A                | Flag 8 is unused. In the PAL version it's turned off in the beginning of event08, and then turned on when going to the Hidden Mansion. It seems that Nintendo was originally using this flag to prevent the Lab from flipping in Hidden Mansion mode, but they settled on an ASM Event tag fix instead.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Gadd. This flag prevents this explanation from occurring again and also removes the Angel Statue requirement from event28 in the Gallery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If Luigi completes the sequence, then this flag will be turned on early at the end of event94. This flag also gives the Courtyard and Foyer Toads: event04 and event17 respectively, new dialogue about the Blackout.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Once Luigi picks the phone up in event93, this flag is turned off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This flag activates event15 so that E. Gadd can warn Luigi about Portrait Ghosts before finding Neville.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

This flag makes sure that event36 and event37 never happen again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
