	Changing banner info and image through GCR is broken, especially for transparent banners, so for that we recommend [DAT Texture Wizard](https://www.lbmwiki.net/tool_pages/DAT_TW).

GCRebuilder (or GCR for short) was created by BSV.

GCR lets you export a root folder from an ISO (or other GameCube disc file), and rebuild a root folder back into a file. For basic usage, [check out this tutorial](https://www.lbmwiki.net/tutorials/03_Root_Extraction/).
