In most cases, you will choose the most recent beta Windows x64 version, which, as the website mentions, requires downloading Microsoft's [x64 Visual C++ redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) if you do not already have it. 
Alternatively, you could download the most recent stable version, found near the bottom of the page.
