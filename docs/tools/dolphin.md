Dolphin Emulator allows you to run mods on hardware other than Nintendo-made hardware, which is convenient for testing mods. If a mod is declared as not console compatible, *that likely means that it is intended to be played via this software.*

In most cases, you will choose the most recent beta Windows x64 version, which, as the website mentions, requires downloading Microsoft's x64 Visual C++ redistributable if you do not already have it. 
Alternatively, you could download the most recent stable version, found near the bottom of the page.
