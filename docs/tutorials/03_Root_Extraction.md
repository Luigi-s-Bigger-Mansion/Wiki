#03 - Root Extraction

!!! info "Note"
	This guide uses GCRebuilder, as mentioned in the previous section. Some may prefer to use DAT Texture Wizard, but this tutorial does not cover using it.

First, you need a Luigi's Mansion ISO file. We **cannot** provide the file to you, but you can either dump your personal disc, or find a copy elsewhere.

##Exporting

Once you have that file, open GCRebuilder and at the top of the window, click Image → Open, and then navigate to wherever you saved your ISO. When you've done that successfully, a file structure should appear on the right side of the window.
Right click the item with the CD icon called “root”, and then press Export. Point to whatever location you would like a root folder to be saved at, and then press Ok. This new folder contains all of the game's files.

##Rebuilding

After you've made your desired changes (more on that later), you can rebuild a root folder into an ISO file.
If you still have the ISO open, choose Image → Close from the top toolbar.
Then, go to Root → Open from the top corner. Navigate to your root folder, and press ok.
After that, navigate to Root → Save to convert those files back into a disc image file. After some time, a popup will appear to note that the process is complete.

Then you're ready to run your hack in Dolphin, or on actual hardware, like via Nintendont or Swiss.
