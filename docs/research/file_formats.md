Luigi's Mansion has a few proprietary file formats, some of which were used in other Nintendo games, while others are unique to this game in particular. Information about each can be found below.

## Tracks character, enemy, furniture, and object info for each map.

[JMP :material-arrow-right: ](file_formats/JMP.md){ .md-button } 

## For animating texture patterns by switching texture indices in MDL file materials.

[TXP :material-arrow-right: ](file_formats/TXP.md){ .md-button }
